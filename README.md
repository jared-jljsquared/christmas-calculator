# christmas-calculator

This is just a simple Typescript / Node / Express app. Its one endpoint returns the number of days until Christmas or wishes you a 'Merry Christmas'.

It is intended that this project will run with Nodes experimental strip types

Additionally, I have added an "/about" endpoint that returns package name and version as I find this extremely helpful when verifying deployment information. To support this endpoint I have configured Typescript to allow for JSON imports.

## Release Notes (reverse chronological)
